- fetches movies from rss feeds (rottentomatoes top movies,apple.com/rss top movies)
- multilingual support
- quality selection / bad word filter (eg 3D)
- saves already fetched movies (in a txt file)

Planned:
- add more search-sites (eg hd-world)
- save alternative links if a package is partly offline
- better search variations and varification 
- include more/custom rss feeds
- hoster prio
- saving already fetched files in sqlite db
- much more
- looking forward to feature requests
